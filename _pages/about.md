## About Me!

Hi! I’m studying **Automotive Engineering** in Hanyang University at Seoul. I am deeply interested in autonomous driving and robotics. I really love what I’m learning, so I’m planning to keep studying about my major.

I’m interested in perception, planning, and control (and even end-to-end learning). There is so much to study, but if we don’t lose our passion, we can always find our way!


Also, I am the President of **[Miru (Mobile Intelligent Robotics Union)](https://github.com/MiRuAE)**. Our club studies autonomous driving technologies, and we also form teams to participate in competitions together. If you are interested, feel free to join us!
